<B>Nothingmore Air Exhaust</B>

A drop in simple mod for V2/Voron Trident. Replaces The existing exhaust housing with something more robust. 

Inspired by 0ndsk4's Nevermore Mod (https://github.com/nevermore3d/Nevermore_Micro)

Changes from stock:
- Ability to use 4mm Activated Carbon Pellets similar to Nevermore
- Ability to easily change carbon filter out
- Improved VOC removal capacity
- An additional Fun option
- Uses most of its parts from the stock BOM (additional heatsets/VHB tape might be needed)
- Acid Free Carbon is not required and therefore easier to source


Future Revisions will be able to:
- Mount multiple/different size fans for additional or quieter airflow
- Ability to mount HEPA filter cartridge to filter particles
- Use slimmer or thicker filter housings for better accomodations of your space



<B>Getting Started</B>
- Sourcing Carbon

Since this filter mod does not live inside the printer similar to the Nevermore, you have the ability to source ANY activated charcoal. 
<B>HOWEVER</B> I HIGHLY reccomend you use acid free activated charcoal!!!!

You don't want to accidently use this carbon internally and rust out your printer!

Please see the Nevermore page for additional explaination. Many of the Voron Resellers have done the difficult work for you, and I highly reccomend you use them. 

Here are some reccomended Voron Resellers:
US: DFH, Fabreeko, 

EU: Lecktor, VonWange

UK: OneTwo3d

AU: Unique Prints, PhaserFPV


Important Note:
I believe you need around 750ml/25oz which is what most resellers sell. Further testing is required. 


<B>Instructions</B>
This is a drop in replacement, the media housing replaces the stock exhaust. 
I reccomend you use VHB tape around the opening similar to how the stock exhaust mounts. However foam insulation tape can be used. 
I would also use VHB tape to help seal the lid as well. Additionally a lid with the option to use Foam Tape (the same from the BOM) is available if you desire. This should help with repeated changes if you forsee opening the lid frequently.

<B>Print Settings</B>

Material: Any is fine. Different materials have different advatages.
ABS because you're a Voron user and a King/Queen
PLA can be used if you want crispy overhangs
PETG can be more water tight than some printers (needs to be very dry when you print it)
T-Glase is EXTREMELY water/air tight
Polypropylene allegedely can hold low level vaccuums 

Print Settings: Stock Voron printing settings are fine.
Optionally you can add a height modifier in Prusa Slicer to remove top and bottom layers, thus creating an easy mesh.
Also I had better luck printing the foam lid, voron logo side down (I may edit this in a later revision so you can print it in either orientation)
