<B>Nothingmore Air Exhaust</B>

A drop in simple mod for V2/Voron Trident. Replaces The existing exhaust housing with something more robust. 

Inspired by 0ndsk4's Nevermore Mod (https://github.com/nevermore3d/Nevermore_Micro)

Changes from stock:
- Ability to use 4mm Activated Carbon Pellets similar to Nevermore
- Ability to easily change carbon filter out
- Improved VOC removal capacity
- An additional Fun option
- Uses most of its parts from the stock BOM (additional heatsets/VHB tape might be needed)


Future Revisions will be able to:
- Mount multiple/different size fans for additional or quieter airflow
- Ability to mount HEPA filter cartridge to filter particles
